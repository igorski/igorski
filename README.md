### Hello kind visitor ðŸ‘‹

On my GitHub you will find all of my personal projects, be it [audio plugins](https://github.com/igorski?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=vst), web based applications or [libraries of any kind](https://github.com/igorski?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=library). All of it for you to see and to get your grubby hands on. All code is production ready (no hidden secrets) and comes with varying degrees of documentation and test coverage. Consult the README of each repo in case you have questions, bug reports or requests.

If you don't feel like tinkering, you can just go to my [website](https://www.igorski.nl) and [run the applications](https://www.igorski.nl/apps) from your browser, or [download the plugins](https://www.igorski.nl/download) there. If you see something horribly wrong, inefficient or containing a crude oversight, feel free to contribute!

All of what I do/make will remain free to use and fully open source. However, if you like what I'm doing and would like to show your appreciation, you may
